## How to Contribute

### Adding Events üìÖ

The easiest way to contribute is by adding new events to our directory. Here's how:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Edit `src/data/events.json`**
3. **Add your event following this format:**

```json
{
  "name": "Event Name",
  "date": "Month Day-Day, Year",
  "location": "City, Province",
  "website": "https://example.com",
  "province": "ON",
  "type": "conference",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
  "isStudentFocused": false,
  "isBeginnerFocused": true,
  "isProfessional": false
}
```

#### Field Guidelines:

- **name**: Full event name
- **date**: Use format like "March 15-16, 2025" or "February 28, 2025"
- **location**: "City, Province" format
- **website**: Official event website
- **province**: Use 2-letter province codes (ON, BC, QC, AB, etc.)
- **type**: Either "conference", "hackathon", or "meetup"
- **tags**: Array of relevant keywords (programming languages, technologies, themes)
- **isStudentFocused**: true if primarily for students, false otherwise
- **isBeginnerFocused** (optional): true if event is designed for beginners/first-time participants
- **isProfessional** (optional): true if event targets industry professionals

#### Optional Field Usage:

**isBeginnerFocused**: Use for hackathons that specifically welcome first-time participants, have beginner tracks, or emphasize learning over competition. This adds a red "Beginner" badge.

**isProfessional**: Use for events that target working professionals, require industry experience, or focus on advanced topics. This adds a black "Professional" badge.

These fields are optional - only include them when they clearly apply to your event.
